# Beeway

Developed during my internship at ict@school/ict@work, Beeway is a web-based scheduling software build for educational institutions, providing a digital solution to replace manual paper-based planning systems.

The platform aims to streamline scheduling processes that were traditionally managed on paper, offering an online alternative for efficiency and accessibility.
